= dtinthâ€™s fork

The goal of this Jamulus fork is focused on improving ways for external apps to programmatically interface Jamulus (both client and server) through a https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/pull/1975[JSON-RPC API] and other features.

NOTE: Due to the stacked diff workflow that I am using, there will be a lot of force-pushes to this branch.

== Differences from upstream

* `json-rpc-docs` Documentation for the JSON-RPC API.
* `json-rpc-fixes` Updates to JSON-RPC API after https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/pull/1975
