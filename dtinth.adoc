The goal of this Jamulus fork is focused on improving ways for external apps to programmatically interface Jamulus (both client and server) through a https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/pull/1975[JSON-RPC API] and other features.

NOTE: Due to the stacked diff workflow that I am using, there will be a lot of force-pushes to this branch.

== Differences from upstream

* `json-rpc-chat` Chat-related JSON-RPC API.
